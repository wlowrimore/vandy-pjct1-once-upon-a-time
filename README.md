# **Once Upon a Time**


## **Description**

As a team of three, we developed this MVP utilizing three APIs to fetch data that would provide the user with sunrise / sunset and historical data.  We wanted to create something unique and fun, yet informative.  We assigned each other the tasks that suited our individual strengths while, at the same time, shared our thoughts, ideas, and resources with one another. This "team style" approach helped to keep us all informed of the others' progresses, and allowed us each to be available for insight and brainstorming.

Along with the APIs, we also used: HTML, Bootstrap, jQuery and CSS.

We, as a team, share many ideas for the future of this MVP, and are all very excited to set out for a fun, interactive and eye catching application.
